1.0.0.2
-------

-Solved the issue with class FilePath. The problem was the conversion of filepaths to String objects: the wrong construction of String was invoked (thanks to C++ implicit conversions! and no, the explicit keyword didn't do any difference), causing filepath parts to not be extracted correctly from the path.

1.0.0.1
-------

Solved the problem with fclose() being called twice,
once from File.close() -> al_fclose() and 
once from ~File() -> al_fclose().
The bug was reported by DanielH (https://www.allegro.cc/members/danielh).

Added a codeblocks project.

Fixed the operator + of class String to be more generic.
